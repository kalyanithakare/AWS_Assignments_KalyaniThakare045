In the cloud, you get resources as a service.
They had categorized it ,which is known as the Levels of abstraction.

        saas(Software as a service)
        For example- Tableau,splunk,storm.Like ms office availabiity is nothing but a software as a service. So whatever softwares used on the industry level are get provided by the cloud as sw as a service.

        paas[Platform as a service]
        It is nothing but a developer facing service means services which are get used by the developer in a day to day life like the hosted database.
        You get any of the database installed by just clicking next next and again it is get managed by the aws.
        Also we get hadoop as a service. and also different IDE's by using which we can develop.

        Iaas[Infrastructure as a service]
        It includes the raw computing resources.
        It includes :
        1] Vm - ec2
        2] disks(volume)

S3

        S3 service- it is the storage engine.
        Storage engine means ,I can store any type of the data there as an object .
        This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.
        How Amazon s3 works?

There is the concept under s3,which is known as the BUCKET
BUCKET:

        An Amazon S3 bucket is a public cloud storage resource available in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3), an object storage offering.
        Amazon S3 buckets, which are similar to file folders, store objects, which consist of data and its descriptive metadata. Bucket is like a folder .
        we make folder under that we store file into that .same thing we can make folder inside the bucket .It is on you upto what level you have to go.
        Here we can also host our website.

How to create Bucket?

Steps:

        Go to services>type S3(scalable storage in the cloud)
        create bucket>Give any name to bucket suppose I give demo>Remaining things keep as it is>click on create bucket

It give error,as it already exisits why is it so?
we had not create bucket before,Then why it is saying that it already exists?
when you create bucket ,bucket name is always region wise like global. In global dropdown it will say that s3 does not require the global selection.
So, this name should be unique across the aws.

        Now give the name as vita-demo-20 > click on create bucket.
        Now our bucket is ready

        Now click on that vita-demo-20
        In that we have different options :
        1] create folder
        2)Upload
        Now let upload some file
        click on the upload
        How to make a folder?
        click on create folder> give the folder name as demo >save
